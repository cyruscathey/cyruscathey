- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cyrus Cathey
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in classic rock and jam tunez, bass guitars (played since I was 14, collector now), technology, gadgets, and computers in general 
- encompassing home automation, entertainment, information, and hobby.  Iâ€™m currently learning the new Intel systems based around the I5 and up processors, the 
- new storage technologies, and inter-actions with the machines.  I just got an i9-12900k with a z690 chipset, m.2 OS storage, 64GB DDR5, and TBD but somewhere 
- near 50TB of hard storage.  I am a music collector and working on converting to digital storage.  I also have Synology 6 disc NAS, expandable to 18 discs, and 
- now with drives at 22TB storage per unit is becoming less of a concern is a huge undertaking.  The results are extremely rewarding.  I have found several 
- projects here that have fit in with my work.  Certainly all the work with FooBar2000 has to be one of the first.  You can't hear digital music without a player
- and I haven't found one I like better than FooBar.  So while I work on serving it up, I am happy to see we have a great group here making it sound great. 
- There are also some interesting file projects I have run across. I move lots of files, big files, to the tune of (no pun intended) 5-10TBs at a time.  I am 
- constantly working with transfer apps, dealing with long file names and paths (songwriters don't really care how long the title of their song is as long as 
- they are satisfied with it), and other vagarities between human nature and Windows 11.  I have my own studio that I developing for my own use.  I don't intend 
- to get into the recording business.  That part is already done for me.  So I am looking forward to seeing all the neat projects that go on here and what I can 
- discover.  I am no expert in the sound business.  I have been in music all my life, but all this digital audio is foreign to me.  I found it odd when people 
- said CDs just didn't have the same feel as albums and live music.  Well, I'm an "analog man in a digital world" as Joe Walsh says.  It is strange to me that we 
- take great live body sound off an analog stage and digitize the crap out of it, then we make analog recordings out of it and sell them for more than the 
- digital recordings.  It is a crazy, mixed up world.  You all will be responsible for the next round of inventions.  I'm done.  I"m coasting now.  I put in 60 
- years or so and boy I would have taken a lot better care of myself if I thought I would still be here today.  So do take care, and wishing you the best on your 
- projects.  Feel free to stop in and chat anytime.  I will do my best to converse at your level <EG>.  It's a pleasure to be here.  A Good Day To All.
